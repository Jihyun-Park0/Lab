# You can instruct CI to skip individual commits by including [CI SKIP] or [SKIP CI] in the commit message. Note this is case-insensitive.

# ==== The Seven Rules ====
# 1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
# 2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
# 3. Capitalize the subject line
# 4. Do not end the subject line with a period
# 5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
# 6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
# 7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
